### Ticket Summary

- **Channel:** Email
- **Category:** Account Access

Because the issue affected a single user and there was no indication of time sensitivity, the priority was set to low.

Here are the steps I took to resolve the issue:

1. Reviewed Active Directory user account status
2. Confirmed the account was not disabled
3. Reset the user’s password in Active Directory
4. Verified “User must change password at next logon” was enabled

A follow up email was sent to the end user instructing her to sign in using the temporary password and create a new password upon successful logon. After successfully resolving the issue, the ticket was closed.
